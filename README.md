## How to Play

1. Use **arrow keys** (↑ ↓ ← →) to move tiles
2. On mobile, **swipe** in any direction
3. When two tiles with the same number touch, they **merge into one**
4. Create a tile with the number **2048** to win!
5. The game is over when you can't make any more moves

## Technology Stack

- **React 19**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Code quality and formatting

## Game Logic

The game implements the classic 2048 rules:

- Grid starts with two random tiles (value 2 or 4)
- After each move, a new tile appears in a random empty position
- Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction
- Adjacent tiles with the same value merge into one
- Score increases by the value of merged tiles
- Win condition: Create a 2048 tile
- Loss condition: No valid moves remaining

## Code Highlights

- **Pure utility functions**: Game logic is separated into testable functions
- **Custom React hook**: Encapsulates game state and event handling
- **TypeScript strict mode**: Full type safety throughout the codebase
- **Error handling**: Async operations wrapped in try-catch blocks
- **Arrow functions**: Following Airbnb style guide conventions
